Trinity Plagiarism Cover in Tex file

## Introduction
Since Trinity College Dublin's plagiarism cover is only available in doc or pdf format, it results in an unfriendly essay writing in a latex environment. So I have restored plagiarism cover using latex, hope it will help you :)

Please note these default settings, which you can change to suit your needs.

+ Font: Default LaTeX font
+ Font size: 12pt
